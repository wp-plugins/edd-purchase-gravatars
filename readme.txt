Displays Gravatars of customers who have purchased your product

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). It outputs gravatars of all the customers who have purchased your product.

It works by using the customer's email that they used to purchase your product, and checking it against Gravatar.com. Only unique email addresses are used, so if a customer purchases your procuct more than once, it will only show their Gravatar once.

To show the Gravatars of customers who have purchased your product, use the [edd_purchase_gravatars] shortcode, or drag the provided widget into the sidebar of your single download page. You can also show the gravatars of a particular product anywhere on your website using the template tag or shortcode, by passing in the download's ID.

Features:

1. Set a heading to display above the Gravatars.
1. Set the size of each Gravatar (512px maximum)
1. Set the minimum number of unique purchases a download must have before the Gravatars are shown. Leave blank for no minimum.
1. Set the maximum number of gravatars to show. Leave blank for no limit.
1. Only show customers with a Gravatar account
1. Randomize the Gravatars
